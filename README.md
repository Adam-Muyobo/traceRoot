## Overview

traceRoot is a blockchain-based system for supply chain transparency. Each product is tagged with a unique QR code, allowing tracking and storing of key information, including:

- **Origin**: Product source (e.g., farm location).
- **Processing**: Steps such as refining and conversion.
- **Logistics**: Shipping and handling data.
- **Retail**: Pricing and value at each stage.

## Workflow

1. **Farm Level**: Farmers tag products with traceRoot QR codes.
2. **Processing**: Refined or processed product details are added.
3. **Logistics**: Shipping updates are captured in real time.
4. **Retail**: Products arrive, and final data is logged.
5. **Consumers**: Scan QR codes to access the productâ€™s journey.

## Features

- **QR-based tracking**: Track every step with secure codes.
- **Blockchain integration**: Immutable records for transparency.
- **Smart contracts**: Automate updates, payments, and more.

## Potential Challenges

- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure data validation at each stage.
- **Scalability**: Use layer-2 solutions for large-scale operations.
- **QR Code Tampering**: Secure tamper-evident tags and NFC tech.
- **Adoption**: Provide training and financial incentives.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/traceroot.git
    cd traceroot
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
4. Access the app at:
    ```
    http://localhost:5000
    ```
5. Scan the QR code to view the product details.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate IoT sensors for real-time data capture.
- Offer consumer rewards for scanning codes.
- Interoperate with existing supply chain systems.
